# IOT System

# Description:

# Usage:

To build our code as a stand-alone application, use the command **gradle run**. 

To access a basic user interface interface, use **user** as the username, and **user** as the password. Once logged in, you should receive one single window showing the IOT system home dashboard.

To access an admin interface, use **admin** as the username, and **admin** as the password. Once logged in, you should receive two windows: one window showing the IOT system home dashboard, and one window showing the admin console.

To run our unit tests, use the command **gradle test**.
